# Emmet snippets and shortcuts for faster HTML &amp; CSS coding

Emmet is enabled by default in VSCode for html, haml, pug, slim, jsx, xml, xsl, css, scss, sass, less and stylus files, as well as any language that inherits from any of the above like handlebars and php.

To enable emmet abbreviations using tab for expansion add this to settings.json
```
"emmet.triggerExpansionOnTab": true
```

Create a div or any other HTML element with a class
```
div.className + tab
```
